- Enumeration

    I saw an SMB Port so, i started an `enum4linux` scan.

    But as we can see, I didn't got any relevant information out of this, but we saw that there exist a CVE to which this SMB is vulnerable to.

    Using Searchsploit to look for that exploit

    ![Blue%208ec273ee118b42b09beb84834720f3e9/Untitled%204.png](Blue%208ec273ee118b42b09beb84834720f3e9/Untitled%204.png)

    This exploit also exists in msfconsole, so we're gonna use that.

- Eternal Blue Explanation

    EternalBlue is an exploit that allows cyber threat actors to remotely execute arbitrary code and gain access to a network by sending specially crafted packets. 

    It exploits a software vulnerability in Microsoftâ€™s Windows operating systems (OS) Server Message Block(SMB) version 1 (SMBv1) protocol, a network file sharing protocol that allows access to files on a remote server. 

    This exploit potentially allows cyber threat actors to compromise the entire network and all devices connected to it. Due to EternalBlueâ€™s ability to compromise networks, if one device is infected by malware via EternalBlue, every device connected to the network is at risk. This makes recovery difficult, as all devices on a network may have to be taken offline for remediation. This vulnerability was patched and is listed on Microsoftâ€™s security bulletin as MS17-010

- Initial Foothold and Escalation

    This is from rapid7's website

    We got the shell ðŸ™‚

    ![Blue%208ec273ee118b42b09beb84834720f3e9/Untitled%207.png](Blue%208ec273ee118b42b09beb84834720f3e9/Untitled%207.png)

    we are `nt authority\system` but that doesnt mean that our process is also `nt authority`,

    so we have to migrate in this situation

    - Why Migrate?

        If you launched a meterpreter payload that doesn't match the target `(windows/meterperter/reverse_tcp vesrus windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp)` you'll have to migrate processes to get an x64 process.

    Find a process towards the bottom of this list that is running at NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM and write down the process id (far left column).
